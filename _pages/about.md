I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the VISICS lab within [ESAT-PSI](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi), where I have been working with [Prof. Tinne Tuytelaars](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~tuytelaa/) since June 2024. My research focuses on Deep Learning and its applications in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. My interests span a range of topics, including leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for multimodal challenges involving images, text, videos, audio, and knowledge graphs; weakly-supervised learning; and (egocentric) video understanding.

In addition, I work as a remote Research Consultant with the [Human-Centric AI group](https://www.neclab.eu/research-areas/data-science/human-centric-ai) at [NEC Labs Europe](https://www.neclab.eu/) (since November 2023). My projects there explore topics such as LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), reasoning, and LLM agents.

During my Ph.D. and Master's studies, I gained valuable experience through Machine Learning research internships at the following organizations:

- **[NEC Labs Europe](https://www.neclab.eu/):** Collaborated with [Kiril Gashteovski](https://www.neclab.eu/research-areas/data-science/human-centric-ai/people/dr-kiril-gashteovski), [Carolin Lawrence](https://carolinlawrence.github.io/), and [Goran Glavas](https://sites.google.com/view/goranglavas), resulting in a publication at EMNLP 2023: [Linking Surface Facts to Large-Scale Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14909).
  
- **[IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/):** Worked with [Jasmina Bogojeska](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=4nOIZLIAAAAJ&hl=de) on medical applications of machine learning, leading to a publication in the *Journal of Infectious Diseases* (2021): [Cohort-Derived Machine Learning Models for Individual Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease in People Living with HIV](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/224/7/1198/5835004).

- **[Luminovo](http://luminovo.ai/):** Contributed to industry-focused Computer Vision solutions.

I completed my Ph.D. in 2024 at KU Leuven, where I also graduated *Cum Laude* with a [Master in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.kuleuven.be/programmes/master-artificial-intelligence) in 2019. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/en) from the University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in North Macedonia in 2017.
