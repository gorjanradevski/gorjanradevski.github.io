I am a Research Consultant with the [Human-Centric AI group](https://www.neclab.eu/research-areas/data-science/human-centric-ai) at [NEC Labs Europe](https://www.neclab.eu/) (since November 2023), where I work on topics such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), reasoning, and LLM agents.  

I completed my Ph.D. in 2024 at KU Leuven and continued as a full-time Postdoctoral Researcher at the VISICS lab within [ESAT-PSI](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) from June 2024 to March 2025, working with [Prof. Tinne Tuytelaars](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~tuytelaa/). I now hold a part-time postdoctoral position at VISICS. My research focuses on Deep Learning and its applications in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, with interests in multimodal learning involving images, text, videos, audio, and knowledge graphs, as well as weakly-supervised learning and (egocentric) video understanding.  

In the past, I did Machine Learning research internships at:  

- **[NEC Labs Europe](https://www.neclab.eu/):** Collaborated with [Kiril Gashteovski](https://www.neclab.eu/research-areas/data-science/human-centric-ai/people/dr-kiril-gashteovski), [Carolin Lawrence](https://carolinlawrence.github.io/), and [Goran Glavas](https://sites.google.com/view/goranglavas), leading to a publication at EMNLP 2023: [Linking Surface Facts to Large-Scale Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14909).  

- **[IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/):** Worked with [Jasmina Bogojeska](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=4nOIZLIAAAAJ&hl=de) on medical applications of machine learning, resulting in a *Journal of Infectious Diseases* (2021) publication: [Cohort-Derived Machine Learning Models for Individual Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease in People Living with HIV](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/224/7/1198/5835004).  

- **[Luminovo](http://luminovo.ai/):** Contributed to industry-focused Computer Vision solutions.  

I graduated *Cum Laude* with a [Master in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.kuleuven.be/programmes/master-artificial-intelligence) from KU Leuven in 2019, after earning my Bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/en) from the University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in North Macedonia in 2017.
