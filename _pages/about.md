I am a PhD student (2019 -- Present) at the VISICS lab within [ESAT-PSI](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) and the [LIIR](https://liir.cs.kuleuven.be/) lab within the [Computer Science Department](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/english) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) under supervision of [Prof. Tinne Tuytelaars](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~tuytelaa/) & [Prof. Marie-Francine Moens](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~sien.moens/).

Starting November 2023, I am working as a Research Consultant at [NEC Labs](https://www.neclab.eu/) in the [Human-Centric AI group](https://www.neclab.eu/research-areas/data-science/human-centric-ai).

My current area of research ordinates around (but it's not limited to) Deep Learning and its applications in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Among other things, I am interested in multimodal problems spanning images, text, videos, audio, knowledge graphs; weakly-supervised learning; (egocentric) video understanding; etc.

I've completed Machine Learning (research) internships at:

- [NEC Labs](https://www.neclab.eu/) (worked with [Kiril Gashteovski](https://www.neclab.eu/research-areas/data-science/human-centric-ai/people/dr-kiril-gashteovski), [Carolin Lawrence](https://carolinlawrence.github.io/) & [Goran Glavas](https://sites.google.com/view/goranglavas))
  - Published at EMNLP (2023): [Linking Surface Facts to Large-Scale Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14909)
- [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/) (worked with [Jasmina Bogojeska](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=4nOIZLIAAAAJ&hl=de))
  - Published in the Journal of Infections diseases (2021): [Cohort-derived machine learning models for individual prediction of chronic kidney disease in people living with HIV](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/224/7/1198/5835004)
- [Luminovo](http://luminovo.ai/)
  - Worked on Computer Vision industry solutions

In the past, I graduated Cum Laude from the [Master in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.kuleuven.be/programmes/master-artificial-intelligence) at KU Leuven in Belgium (2019), and before I did a Bachelor in [Computer Science](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/en) at University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in North Macedonia (2017).
