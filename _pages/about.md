I am a Research Associate (June 2024 -- present) at the VISICS lab within [ESAT-PSI](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) working together with [Prof. Tinne Tuytelaars](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~tuytelaa/). My current area of research ordinates around (but it is not limited to) Deep Learning and its applications in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Among other things, I am interested in the applications of LLMs on multimodal problems spanning images, text, videos, audio, knowledge graphs; weakly-supervised learning; (egocentric) video understanding; etc.

Additionally, I am working as a (remote) Research Consultant at [NEC Labs](https://www.neclab.eu/) in the [Human-Centric AI group](https://www.neclab.eu/research-areas/data-science/human-centric-ai) (November 2023 -- present). The projects I work on involve Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and enhancing the interpretability of LLMs.

During my PhD and Master's studies I completed Machine Learning (research) internships at:

- [NEC Labs](https://www.neclab.eu/) (worked with [Kiril Gashteovski](https://www.neclab.eu/research-areas/data-science/human-centric-ai/people/dr-kiril-gashteovski), [Carolin Lawrence](https://carolinlawrence.github.io/) & [Goran Glavas](https://sites.google.com/view/goranglavas))
  - Published at EMNLP (2023): [Linking Surface Facts to Large-Scale Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14909)
- [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/) (worked with [Jasmina Bogojeska](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=4nOIZLIAAAAJ&hl=de))
  - Published in the Journal of Infections diseases (2021): [Cohort-derived machine learning models for individual prediction of chronic kidney disease in people living with HIV](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/224/7/1198/5835004)
- [Luminovo](http://luminovo.ai/)
  - Worked on Computer Vision industry solutions

In the past, I finished a PhD (2024) and graduated Cum Laude from the [Master in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.kuleuven.be/programmes/master-artificial-intelligence) (2019) at KU Leuven, and did a Bachelor in [Computer Science](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/en) at University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in North Macedonia (2017).
