I am a third year PhD student at the VISICS lab within [ESAT-PSI](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) and the [LIIR](https://liir.cs.kuleuven.be/) lab within the [Computer Science Department](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/english) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) under supervision of [Prof. Tinne Tuytelaars](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~tuytelaa/) and [Prof. Marie-Francine Moens](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~sien.moens/).

<br>
My current area of research ordinates around (but it's not limited to) Deep Learning and its applications in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Among other things, I am interested in multi-modal spatial understanding, combining the visual and text modalities to obtain multimodal representations, learning from limited data, etc. So far, I've published work on time-series analysis, scene generation, text groundnding, (compositional) action recognition.

<br>
Before starting my PhD studies, I graduated Cum Laude from a [Master of Artificial Intelligence](http://mai.kuleuven.be/) at KU Leuven, interned at [Luminovo](http://luminovo.ai/) in Germany and at [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/) in Switzerland. More in the past, I did a bachelor in [Computer Science](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/en) at University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in North Macedonia.
